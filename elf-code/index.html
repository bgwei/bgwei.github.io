        <p>This challenge was a mini-game designed to introduce people new to JavaScript - which was definitely me, so it was very helpful! 
            Considering JavaScript shows up everywhere online (and on the website for the con), it’s certainly useful to have a 
            <a href="https://jgthms.com/javascript-in-14-minutes/">primer</a>. You might even be able to solve some of the other challenges by
            understanding and manipulating the JavaScript source for the page. And, as a bonus, the game was a lot of fun! </p>
        <p>Anyways, the player is tasked with moving around a grid to collect lollipops and reach the green circle. 
            The player is given a number of methods which are fairly straightforward (elf.moveLeft(2) moves the elf two spaces left for example) 
            to work with and some constraints on the code. Note that one of these constraints is always code length - 
            if you find your code is too long you could minify it. For example, my original 27-line code for Level 7 could be minified to just 7 with 
            <a href="https://javascript-minifier.com/">this tool!</a></p>
        <p>There are also levers which activate/deactivate traps and enemy “munchkins.” In order to activate the levers or neutralize the munchkins, 
            the player must complete an additional programming challenge and submit its output to the lever/munchkin.</p>
